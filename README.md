# Welcome to Nysor

Yet another graphical interface for Neovim.

Written in Python, with Qt.

Pronounced similar to "visor", the "y" like in "eye"... "n-eye-sor".


# Why another GUI for Neovim?

It's basically a pet project: one aimed to learn about Neovim and how to use it programmatically. But at the same time the idea is to provide a high quality interface for the everyday usage.
